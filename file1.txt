DSL is a high-speed Internet connection, 
which utilizes the standard telephone lines, but allows digital signals to 
be carried rather than analogue.
The most commonly installed DSL technology for Internet access
is ADSL. It is asymmetric because 
the download speed is faster than upload speed. DSL-based services are a 
low-cost option when compared to other solutions offering similar 
bandwidth, so they can be made available to customers at extremely 
competitive prices.
A dial-up connection to the Internet is set up by dialing a phone number, hence the 
name. 
Cable Internet is a form of broadband Internet access that uses the 
infrastructure of cable TV networks to provide Internet services. 
A cable connection is highly reliable and is not subject to outages 
due to storms, like satellite Internet. However, since residential cable 
Internet access is provided through shared bandwidth, the speed can be 
slower during peak usage hours when a lot of Internet users are online. 
This does not happen with a DSL network, where each subscriber has their own dedicated line.
Fiber-optic Internet uses fiber-optic cables instead of copper wires 
and it is incredibly fast. Those cables send data to and from a computer 
by harnessing the power of light and can carry data over long distances 
with low attenuation and distortion of the light signal.
The three wireless technologies widely used today are Wi-Fi, 
cellular and satellite Internet. Wi-Fi uses radio waves to wirelessly 
connect devices and is commonly applied for local area networking.
Satellite Internet Access can provide high-speed Internet where the conventional 
cable or DSL is either not available or not functioning well. To get access 
to the Internet, one needs a satellite dish for two-way (upload and 
download) data communications and a modem.

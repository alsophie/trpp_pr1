The World Wide Web (WWW), is an information system accessible through 
the Internet where documents and other web resources are identified by 
a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The Web is a hypertext-based system . 
You can click on keywords or buttons that take you to other pages or other websites. 
This is possible because browsers understand Hypertext Markup Language.
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.

Although the format of an email message is rigidly defined, different email protocols transfer 
and store messages in slightly different ways.
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used for sending email over the 
Internet. Email clients (such as Outlook, Mail.ru, Gmail, Yandex) use 
SMTP to transfer messages to the mail server and the mail server uses 
SMTP to relay that message to the correct receiving server. Once a 
message has been delivered, it can't be recalled or cancelled.
Post Office Protocol (POP) allows you to download email messages on 
your local computer and read them even when you are offline.
When you use POP3 to connect to your email account, messages are 
downloaded locally and removed from the email server. This means that 
if you access your account from multiple devices, that may not be the  best option.
Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) is similar in operation to POP3, but 
allows you more choice over what messages you download. Initially, only 
message headers are retrieved, giving information about the sender and 
subject. You can then download just those messages you want to read and 
delete individual messages from the server. Another great advantage of 
IMAP over POP3 is the opportunity to organize your mail into folders. 
IMAP is more suitable for you if youâ€™re going to access your email from 
different devices (your desktop PC, tablet, smartphone) or if your 
messages are managed by multiple users.
